# Gatling [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/excilys/gatling.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/excilys/gatling)

Gatling versions 2.0.0-M3a and lower build with `maven`, master builds with `sbt`.

## What is Gatling ?

Gatling is a stress tool.
Development is currently focusing on HTTP support.

## Motivation

* Finding fancy GUIs not that convenient for describing stress tests, what you want is a friendly expressive DSL?
* Wanting something more convenient than huge XML dumps to store in your source version control system?
* Fed up with having to host a farm of injecting servers because your tool uses blocking IO and one-thread-per-user architecture?

Gatling is for you!

## Underlying technologies

Gatling is developed in Scala and built upon :

* [Async Http Client](https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client) and [Netty](http://netty.io) for non blocking HTTP
* [Akka](http://akka.io) for actions (requests, pauses, assertions, etc...) modeling and orchestration
