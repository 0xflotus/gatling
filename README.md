# What is Gatling ?

Gatling is a stress tool.
Development is currently focusing on HTTP support.

# Motivation

* Fed up with fancy GUI that generate huge unreadable XML scenarios, what you want is scripts and a user friendly DSL?
* Fed up with having to host a farm of injecting servers because your tool use blocking IO and one-thread-per-user architecture?

Gatling is for you!

# Underlying technologies

Gatling is built upon :

* [Async Http Client](https://github.com/sonatype/async-http-client) and [Netty](http://www.jboss.org/netty) for non blocking HTTP
* Akka for actions (requests, pauses, assertions, etc...) modeling and orchestration
* Scala REPL for scripting
* [VTD-XML](http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net) for XPath support

# State
Currently under development.
We aim for a 0.9 version by the end of september.
