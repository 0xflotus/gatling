Gatling is a highly capable load testing tool.

It is designed for easy of use, maintainability and high performance.

Out of the box, Gatling comes with an excellent support of the HTTP protocol and makes it a tool of choice for load testing any HTTP server.

Moreover, the core engine is actually protocol agnostic, so it's perfectly possible to implement other protocols support.
For example, Gatling currently also ships JMS support.

The :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>` has an overview of the most important concepts, walking you through the setup of a simple scenario for load testing an HTTP server.
