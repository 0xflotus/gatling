Recorder
********

The Gatling Recorder helps you to quickly generate scenarios. It acts as a HTTP proxy between the browser and the HTTP server. While you navigate through the application, it records all HTTP exchange and when done, generates the scenario simulating what you just did.

Launch it from the bundle with the following script ``$GATLING_HOME/bin/recorder.sh``.
You will get a window that looks like this one:

Configuration
=============

Local proxy ports
-----------------

In the Recorder, you have to define two ports: one for listening to HTTP traffic and one for HTTPS traffic. Then, you have to configure your browser to use the definied ports.

Here is how to do with Firefox, open the browser settings:

Then, update the connection settings:

.. note:: HTTPS port isn't mandatory if you don't plan to use an HTTPS connection.


Outgoing proxy
--------------

If you must access your web application through a proxy, you can set it up in this section. As the configuration of local ports, two different ports can be defined for the outgoing proxy (HTTP & HTTPS).

.. note:: If HTTP and HTTPS are on the same port for the outgoing proxy, you need to explicitly specify both.

Running
=======

Once everything has been configured, press the **Start** button to launch the recorder.

Recorded Events
---------------

As you navigate through your application, the recorder will log three kinds of events:

* **Requests**: The requests sent by the browser.
* **Pauses**: The time between each request.
* **Tags**: Manually set markers.

Tag Events
----------

To make your scenario more understandable, you can add tags, they will appear as comments in the scenario: ``/* my tag */``

To add a tag, fill in the text field provided and press the **Add** button. After that, the tag will be displayed in the list below.

.. example:: ``TAG | my tag``


Stop
----

When you have finished recording your scenario, press the **Stop** button to save it in the format defined in the configuration.

HAR Files
=========

You can import a HAR file (Http Archive) into the Recorder and convert it to a Gatling simulation. HAR files can be obtained using the Chrome Developer Tools or with Firebug and the NetExport Firebug extension. To import a HAR file, select the *HAR converter* mode in the top right dropdown in the Recorder.
