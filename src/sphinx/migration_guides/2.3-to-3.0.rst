.. _2.3-to-3.0:

#########################
Migrating from 2.3 to 3.0
#########################

* JMS ``reqreply`` was renamed into ``requestReply``
* ``bodies`` and ``data`` directories were dropped, now those files are resolved from classpath root, see `#3398 <https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/3398>`__.
* CLI ``-m``/``--mute`` option was dropped, now Gatling is automatically mute when you set the simulation class name
* CLI no longer prompts for a user defined simulationId
* JsonPath check's ``ofType`` now deep converts to Scala ``Map``s and ``Seq``s, so you'll no longer get Java types deep into the object
* ``extraInfoExtractor`` was dropped as it wasn't used in any Gatling component
* gatling-maven-plugin options' aliases were dropped, use full option names instead
* ``transformResponse`` now takes a second ``Session`` parameter
* Drop deprecated gatling-maven-plugin's ``execute`` task, use ``test`` instead
* ``baseURL`` was renamed into ``baseUrl``
* ``silentURI`` was renamed into ``silentUri``
* Gatling now has its own HTTP client and no longer uses AsyncHttpClient (so AHC is no longer shipped)
* Maven users must upgrade gatling-maven-plugin to `3.0 <https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:gatling-maven-plugin>`__.
* WebSocket and SSE support were completely re-written, `see new API <http-ws>`__.
* ``matchByMessageID`` was renamed into ``matchByMessageId`` and ``matchByCorrelationID`` was renamed into ``matchByCorrelationId``
* ``over`` inject method was renamed into ``during``
* ``splitUsers`` is dropped in favor of ``incrementUsersPerSec`` and ``incrementConcurrentUsers``
* ``ntmlAuth`` is dropped until we can support NTLM properly, see `#3525 <https://github.com/gatling/gatling/issues/3525>`__
