Migrating from Gatling 2.0-M3a to Gatling 2.0-RC1
#################################################

Global changes
==============

Gatling requires at least JDK7u6
--------------------------------

As targeting newer JDKs provides bug fixes, speed improvements and opens opportunities for optimizations,
Gatling now requires at least a JDK7u6 (released almost two years ago already).

Gatling is now available on Maven Central
-----------------------------------------

Gatling releases are now available on Maven Central, and snapshots are deployed on each successful build by Travis CI to Sonatype's snapshots repository.
If you were using Gatling with its Maven plugin, you no longer need to add the Excilys repository in your ``pom.xml``.
