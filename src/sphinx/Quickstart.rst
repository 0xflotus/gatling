In this section we will use Gatling to load test a simple cloud hosted web server and will introduce you to the basic elements of the DSL. Altough we consider it possible to use the DSL without much `Scala <http://www.scala-lang.org/>`_ knowledge, we may recommand to have a quick look at `Scala School <http://twitter.github.io/scala_school>`_.
